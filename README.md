This is a Docker image containing a [`TeX Live`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live) installation with many required packages and several fonts.
The goal is to provide a full `Tex Live` installation from [islandoftex/texlive](https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texlive)

Unfortunately, all in all, this makes the container rather big and not very suitable as base image for my other LaTeX-related containers.
Thus, I also have a smaller `Tex Live` installation with fewer fonts and utils, namely [docker-texlive-thin](http://www.github.com/sanjib-sen/texlive-thin).
